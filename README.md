# Pac-Man-ASM
Pac Man in Assembly Language using Irvine Library
Overview:
The following code implements PAC Man in Assembly Language with three levels using the Irvine Library.

**Demo Video:** https://youtu.be/nHjAcq6TUkk

Key Features:

-> Each step has been encapsulated into different PROCs for modularity.

-> Wall collision detection is hardcoded for Levels 1 and 2, but Level 3 utilizes an Array as a reflection of the game grid for collision checks.

-> Coin positions for Levels 1 and 2 are stored in an array, which is then traversed when the player passes through those points.

-> In Level 3, both the coins and the player's position are stored in an array, and the player's position is checked within it.

-> Ghost movement is hardcoded in each level, and a delay is set to control the gameplay speed.

-> Music has been integrated into the game, and the corresponding source files have been included.

-> File handling for high scores has not been implemented.
